# 🎬 Streaming Platform Analysis (KDD Approach)

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **preferred streaming platforms** based on **viewer demographics** (age, gender, location) and **genre preferences**. Using **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** and **Data Mining (KDD process)**, it uncovers hidden patterns in user behavior and predicts streaming app preferences.

The project demonstrates the synergy of **data warehousing** and **machine learning classification**, offering insights for **content personalization, marketing strategies, and platform optimization**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 **Data Warehousing**: Star, Snowflake, and Fact Constellation schemas
* 🔎 **OLAP Operations**: Slice, Dice, Roll-up, Drill-down, Pivot using MDX queries
* 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Classification models (Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN)
* 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
* 📊 **Visualization**: Orange Data Mining tool for plots and trees
* 🎯 **Prediction Model**: Forecasts user-preferred streaming platform

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Database & OLAP**: SQL Server, SSMS, SSAS (Analysis Services), MDX
* **ETL & Schema Design**: Microsoft Visual Studio
* **Machine Learning & Visualization**: Orange Data Mining Tool
* **Data Storage & Processing**: CSV, Excel

## ⚙️ Methodology (KDD Process)

1. **Data Collection** – Google Forms dataset (demographics, genre, app usage)
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, encoding
3. **Schema Design** – Star, Snowflake, Fact Constellation schemas in SQL Server
4. **OLAP Operations** – Executed with MDX queries on SSAS cubes
5. **Visualization** – OLAP results plotted using Orange Data Mining tool
6. **Data Mining** – Classification with Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN
7. **Prediction** – Model predicts user-preferred streaming platform

---

## 📊 Results

* **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (\~90%+) for predicting user preferences
* Netflix showed strong preference across **Action, Thriller, Drama**
* Disney+ Hotstar dominated **Family and Kids content**
* Amazon Prime balanced across **Comedy, Drama, Regional content**
* Insights:

  * Teens/Young Adults prefer Netflix
  * Families choose Disney+ Hotstar
  * Prime Video appeals to mixed demographics

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

* **Bar Plot** – Genre vs Platform popularity
* **Decision Tree** – Viewer classification workflow
* **Confusion Matrix** – Model accuracy evaluation

👉 Do you also want me to create a **requirements.txt** (listing Orange, SQL Server, etc.) and a **sample SQL + MDX query folder structure** for GitHub? That way your repo will look professional and complete.
